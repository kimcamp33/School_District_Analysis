### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

#### Math and reading scores by grade

Replacing the math and reading scores does not change the data much.  It removes the blank scores but most of the data remain the same and the schools'  performance compared to each other also remains the same.  

#### Scores by school spending

The scores based on spending remain exactly the same.  Taking away the null data does not affect scores by school spending.

#### Scores by school size

Similarly to school spending, the scores by school size also remained similar.

#### Scores by school type

Removing the 9th grade data does very little to the scores based on school type.  The charter schools continue to outperform the district in all areas.
